###Overview  
As part of Dr. Jenny Bryan's STAT545 and STAT547M data wrangling courses, we wrote R code and Rmd reports to present our understanding of R data wrangling and visualization. Homework 1-5 is part of STAT545 covering basic concepts of data readin, manipulation and plotting. Homework 6-10 is part of STAT547M covering data cleanup (munging)
