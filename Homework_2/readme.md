The files in this folder are for Homework 2 of the stat545a course @ UBC taught by Dr. Jenny Bryan

1. Homework2_files contains the figures for each of the plot chunks
2. original_R_script is the original R script I wrote before transferring the chunks into R markdown
3. Homework2.Rmd, .html,.md are all the same file in different formats
4. gapminderDataFiveYear.txt is the same data as loading library(gapminder)
